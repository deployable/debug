# Debug

`debug` like the [nodejs debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug)
, but rubyish

## Installation

Install globally 

    $ gem install debug

Or add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'debug'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

You include `Debug` in the classes you want to run the 
`debug` method in

The DEBUG environment variables controls debug logging
for classes with space or comma seperated Module/Class namespaces

    DEBUG='MySuperClass"

Would enable debug in the `MySuperClass` alone

    DEBUG='Class::Sub::*,Other::*'

Would turn debug on for any Objects including `Debug` scoped under `Class::Sub::` and `Other::`

```ruby
class Something
  include Debug

  def some_method
    a = "3208f23-23".split 2
    debug 'split', a
  end
end

Something.new.some_method
```

    $ DEBUG='Something' ruby something.rb
